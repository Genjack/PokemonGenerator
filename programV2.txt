TO DO LIST

Premise: A file is read in from command-line parameter. A linked list is
    created, and if the file isn't null, the list and file pointer are passed
    to a function which parses the file line by line. Command structs are 
    malloced with a function pointer and void pointer, and each string from 
    each line is assigned to the relevant pointer, until the file is complete
    (or if invalid). From there, each list item is removed one by one, and the
    contents are used to complete their purpose before the node is freed.
    After the list is depleted, the program ends.

LEFT TO DO
1) Figure out why the picture doubles up - something to do with cursor
2) Create a log file and a sensible way to append to it
3) Compile report.
